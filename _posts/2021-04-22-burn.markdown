<p>
You did not read the fine print.<br />  
People are for profit.<br />
“Go vote, or choke on it”.<br />
This has been a broken system.<br />
How could you not know of it?
</p>

<p>
You too cannot ask for O<sub>2</sub><br />
Even if you swelled up the crowd<br />
They asked you to go to,<br />
Even if you lowered your guards<br />
For good days, (doom) and profit.
</p>

<p>
How did you miss the fine print?<br />
These days are not for you.<br />
The "good" has fooled you too.<br />
The profit’s not for you.<br />
You are a data point. Yes, you too.
</p>

<p>
How can you miss the fine print?<br />
The doom is all around.<br />
Sit in your homes and die.<br />
Predators on the ground.<br />
Can’t you feel that howling cry?
</p>

<p>
Yet, you missed the fine print.<br />
"Doom" was written in the center of it all.<br />
Those beds are not for you.<br />
Sleep on the streets. Yes, you too.<br />
Who can you call when ambulances are hearses?<br />
</p>

<p>
What's the point in these verses<br />
When surviving is a privilege,<br />
When you may be dead<br />
But being counted is a privilege?<br />
The fine print is now in big bold text.
</p>

<p>
If you still can’t believe it,<br />
Just go searching, and<br />
You shall find how<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bodies, they turn, they turn,<br />
They turn up, on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyres, they burn, they burn,<br />
They burn as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Liars, they run, they run,<br />
They run this show.
</p>
