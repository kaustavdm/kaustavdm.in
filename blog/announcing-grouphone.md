Today, we at [Applait](http://applait.com) [announced a new service](http://blog.applait.com/123) that we call "[Grouphone](http://grouphone.applait.com)". It is a multi-party audio call conferencing service over the internet. We'll be bringing it to Firefox OS as an early beta this month, and have plans to roll out versions for Android and iOS soon.

I'll write more about it in details in near future. All I can say now is that it is based on WebRTC.

Oh, and we'll have limited seats for the early beta. So, if you find it interesting, do sign up for an early beta invitation :-D
