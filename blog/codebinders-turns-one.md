The first birthday of CodeBinders! The last year went past pretty fast and served as a reminder of how time flies. Last year, on this day, CB was incorporated. It has been a tough journey since then, trying to balance between the new requirements of work, family, study and health.

But it has not all been in vain. We have gained a lot of experience in the process. Now we are all set to dedicate our energies to CodeBinders. Happy Birthday CB!
