I have been an emacs user for over 4 years now. I have gone through multiple stages in the lifespan of my Emacs usage. I started off by customizing only using a single `.emacs` file. Now I have a full featured emacs setup, tweaked for working in JavaScript.

I used to use Sublime Text 2 for nearly six months in between. I loved its speed and minimal looks.

But I always missed the keybindings and workflow that I had got used to in emacs.

A few days ago I found this project called [`sublemacspro`](https://github.com/grundprinzip/sublemacspro). It lets you use emacs keybindings and some common emacs usage patterns in Sublime Text. Installing it was a breeze, and now I have an emacs like interface in Sublime.

Need to tweak it further, but this will do for now.  I am currently in a phase of transition. I've been using both the editors and trying to see which one helps _me_ be more productive.

Text editor flame wars are welcome.
