While a good number of events around Firefox OS have focused on helping developers understand the technology behind it, there has been very little effort in helping people understand Firefox OS from a non-technical and non-developer perspective.

I've started a series of events titled "Firefox OS for everyone" to solve this gap.<!-- more -->

The content has been assimilated from my efforts in presenting Firefox OS to developers, managers, people in marketing and sales, businesses, consumers and investors. The aim is to encourage participants to have a full overview of the ecosystem around Firefox OS and how they can present it to the world at large; to anyone.

We had the first iteration of the event on February 26, 2015 at the [Mozilla Community Space Bangalore](https://www.facebook.com/mozillabangalore). The [next iteration](https://events.mozspaces.org/e/888/20150228160000/firefox-os-for-everyone) is scheduled at 4pm, February 28, 2015 at the same venue.

The slides are available [online](http://www.slideshare.net/kaustavdm/fxos-foreveryone).
