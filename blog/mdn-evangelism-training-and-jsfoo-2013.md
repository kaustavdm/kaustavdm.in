The whole of last week was an amazing blur. I was in Bangalore for two events, one day apart. As part of the MDN India Tour 2013, there was a Mozilla Evangelism Training on 17-18 September, 2013, followed by [JSFoo](http://jsfoo.in) on 20-21 September. It gave the Mozilla India community to interact with Christian Heilmann, Robert Nyman, Ali Spivak and Francois Marier.<!-- more -->



# Evangelism Training



The Evangelism training was conducted by [Christian Heilmann](http://christianheilmann.com/). Christian covered various points about how to give an effective presentation. Our prime focus was to learn to give demos of [Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/os) at JSFoo. The training was conducted at Red Hat, Bangalore.

# Giving demos of Firefox OS



After giving us an idea of how we would present Firefox OS, [Ali Spivak](https://twitter.com/alispivak) had us give a trial presentation on FxOS. I presented to Christian.

# JSFoo



Mozilla was a travel sponsor at JSFoo and we got a chance to represent Mozilla and spread word about Firefox OS and Mozilla's mission at the premier Javascript conference. The best part of the conference was to meet a good number of people who were interested to contribute to Mozilla.
