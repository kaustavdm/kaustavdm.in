What if the purpose of life is to find out that there needs to be a purpose of life? That, it is an intelligence barrier poised to filter out non-intelligent species? What if, from thereafter, that species is free to carry out whatever goal it wants to pursue without bothering about any predefined ultimate goal or purpose?

Does that change anything?
