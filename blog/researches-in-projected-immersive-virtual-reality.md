Microsoft Research has been working on "IllumiRoom", a system to project media across the room, giving an immersive virtual reality experience. It is something that takes 3D movies to a whole new scale.

Recently, a similar idea called "[Immersis](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/catopsys/immersis)" raised over 100K USD on Kickstarter.

It will be interesting to see who hits it first and whether this becomes a viable form in the consumer entertainment space.
