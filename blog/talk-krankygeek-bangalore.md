I'll be speaking about the state of WebRTC in Firefox at [Kranky Geek's WebRTC event][kranky] in Bangalore on March 19, 2016.

Here is the talk abstract:

> Mozilla is a strong proponent of decentralized, privacy-aware communications, and the principles behind WebRTC align very closely with the Mozilla mission. Mozilla has launched "Firefox Hello" last year, a WebRTC driven live video chat system that now ships with the Firefox web browser. This talk will explore the path ahead for WebRTC implementations in Firefox and it will show what is already available in the latest Firefox nightly through some demos.

[Tickets][tickets] for this event are available for free. So, grab yours!
