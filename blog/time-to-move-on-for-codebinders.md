Nearly two years have passed since [CodeBinders](http://www.codebinders.com) was formed. CodeBinders turns two this December. These two years have been full of wonderful experiences and useful lessons. What started off as a consultancy firm has now gathered the impetus to invest in more productive ideas and quality research. CodeBinders is now brave enough to shed its old image and give full time to product development. As our partner in crime, we are in talks with other organizations who are ready to put in their minds and hands to something innovative, something new, in collaboration with us.<!-- more -->



## Why this move?



We have been planning this move for some time now. But lack of funds to support our research and development had kept us from doing this so far. We have always yearned to work with the latest technologies and bring them within reach of the normal user. This goal is however not practical at all times. Clients always want quick returns. As a consultancy firm, our target has been to ensure that we deliver best quality at affordable price. The problem in this approach is that you are not paid enough to give time to improve and innovate your services.

We still managed to squeeze some amount of innovation into our daily business by creating reusable products like an [admin framework on Laravel 3](https://github.com/codebinders/admin-framework), with [pages/categories](https://github.com/codebinders/pages) and [photo gallery](https://github.com/codebinders/photos) support. But these were not enough to contain our thirst for learning new technologies.

We needed something more exciting.



## The changing factor



The main reason behind our decision to finally invest in product development is my new job at [FusionCharts](http://www.fusioncharts.com). This job meant having enough funds to sustain myself and investing the spare time for CodeBinders. This reduced the dependency on CodeBinders to remain a services company to ensure we made some money out of consultancy. We can now freely let CodeBinders, in any form, to become a product oriented company instead of its current form.



## So what is next?



As part of my involvement with [Mozilla](http://kaustavdm.in/category/mozilla), I have been dabbling with [Firefox OS](http://firefox.com/os) for some time now. This will be an excellent segment for us to focus on.

We also have some long-awaited product ideas which will gradually see the light of the day now. Finally, we can do something new and something exciting. This means we have been successfully able to cross the first hurdle as a startup where we can migrate from providing services for existing solutions to creating our own solutions. My sincerest thanks to all those whose support made this possible.

This new avatar will be a lovely birthday gift for CodeBinders on its second birthday!
