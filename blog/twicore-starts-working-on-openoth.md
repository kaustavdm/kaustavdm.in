We, at [TwiCore](http://www.twicore.com/), have started to work on an open-source online treasure hunt application, named [OpenOTH](https://launchpad.net/openoth) for the time being. It is mainly targeted for use in online treasure hunt games conducted by various techfests. However, the scope of OpenOTH will not be limited to this.

Work on the project has just begun and it is still incomplete. So, please do not try to use it for production purposes.<!-- more -->
