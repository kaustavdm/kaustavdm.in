Are you a web developer looking to get your feet wet in the open source world? Do you have skills in Python, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript? Do you like helping other developers learn more about the technologies underlying the web? If your answer to all the above questions is "Yes", you may want to contribute to the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org).<!-- more -->



# Where to get started



The Mozilla Developer Network's (MDN, aka, DevMo) source code is codenamed **Kuma**. Development is done publicly on [Kuma's Github repository](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma). Lists of bugs for Kuma can be found on [BugMo](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org) under the [product category of "Mozilla Developer Network"](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Mozilla%20Developer%20Network).

To begin with Kuma, read up [Kuma's page on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma) or jump directly to the [Contributing to Kuma](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma/Contributing) page.

Before you decide to work on any feature or a bug that you found, get in touch with **lorchard**, **groovecoder** or **davidwalsh** on _#mdndev_ on _irc.mozilla.org_.

Right now, you can come and join the team and help us to iron out several small bugs for the new MDN redesign!

Hope to see you aboard!
